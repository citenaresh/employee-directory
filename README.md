## Description

This is a [React](https://reactjs.org/) app that lets you view a list of employees, search for a specific employee, 
and sort the employee by either name or department. When you search for an employee it will immediately give you a 
result and clicking on the buttons will sort the employees either in ascending or descending order.
      

## Technologies

[Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styles.
